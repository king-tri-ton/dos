# DDoS Script README

## Overview
This script is a simple implementation of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using Python. It utilizes the threading module to concurrently send HTTP requests to a specified website, causing a potential denial of service by overwhelming the target server with traffic.

**Disclaimer:** This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script to conduct DDoS attacks on websites or networks without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `requests` module installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```
  pip install requests
  ```

## Usage
1. Open the script file (`attack.py`) in a text editor.
2. Set the target URL in the `requests.get` function. Replace `"https://site.com/"` with the URL of the target website.
3. Save the changes to the script file.

## Execution
Run the script using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
python attack.py
```

The script will start launching multiple threads, each sending HTTP requests to the specified website with a predefined user-agent. The attack will continue indefinitely until manually stopped.

## Important Notes
- Use this script responsibly and only on systems and networks for which you have explicit permission.
- Unauthorized use of this script may lead to legal consequences.
- Be aware that conducting DDoS attacks is a violation of the terms of service of most internet service providers and can result in severe penalties.
